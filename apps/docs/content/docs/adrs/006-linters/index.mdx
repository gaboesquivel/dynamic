title: "ADR 006: Linters and Code Formatters"
description: "Decision to use Biome for fast formatting and ESLint for rule enforcement only, optimized for speed and developer experience with Bun bundler."
---

## Context

We need to select linting and formatting tools for our monorepo that:

- Enforce code quality and consistency across all packages
- Support TypeScript, React, and Elysia
- Integrate well with our monorepo structure and tooling
- Provide **excellent developer experience** with fast feedback
- Work seamlessly with our build tools (Turbo, Next.js, Elysia, Bun)
- **Maximize speed** - we use Bun bundler and package manager for fastest possible workflows
- Have strong ecosystem support and community

## Considered Options

### Option A – Biome + ESLint (Chosen)

Biome for fast formatting, ESLint for rule enforcement only.

**Pros**

- **Maximum speed**: Biome is written in Rust, providing extremely fast formatting
- **Optimized workflow**: ESLint disabled for checks Biome handles, making linting faster
- **Best of both worlds**: Biome's speed for formatting, ESLint's mature ecosystem for rules
- **Bun integration**: Works seamlessly with Bun bundler and package manager
- **Excellent DX**: Fast feedback loops, minimal waiting time
- **All-in-one formatting**: Biome handles all formatting concerns (faster than Prettier)
- **ESLint for rules only**: Focused on code quality rules, not formatting (faster execution)
- **TypeScript support**: Both tools support TypeScript well
- **Monorepo friendly**: Works well with Turborepo and Bun workspaces
- **Modern tooling**: Latest generation of dev tools optimized for speed

**Cons**

- Requires configuring ESLint to disable checks Biome handles
- Two tools to maintain (but optimized for speed)
- Biome is newer than Prettier (but mature enough for production use)

### Option B – ESLint + Prettier

Separate linting and formatting tools working together.

**Pros**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugin library
- Excellent support for TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Elysia
- Wide range of community-maintained rules and configurations
- Native support for Next.js with `@next/eslint-plugin-next`
- Strong integration with React and React Hooks
- Battle-tested in production environments

**Cons**

- **Slower than Biome**: Prettier is JavaScript-based, slower than Rust-based Biome
- Requires two tools (ESLint + Prettier) with configuration overhead
- Need to ensure ESLint and Prettier don't conflict (solved with eslint-config-prettier)
- **Not optimized for speed**: Doesn't align with our Bun-first, speed-optimized strategy
- Less suitable for fast feedback loops we prioritize

### Option C – Biome only

Using Biome for both linting and formatting.

**Pros**

- Single tool for both linting and formatting
- Extremely fast (Rust-based)
- Simpler setup

**Cons**

- Less mature linting rules compared to ESLint
- Smaller ecosystem for framework-specific rules (Next.js, Elysia)
- Limited React-specific rules compared to ESLint
- Less tested with complex monorepo setups
- Would lose access to ESLint's extensive rule ecosystem

## Decision

We will use **Biome + ESLint** for formatting and linting, optimized for **speed** and **developer experience**.

### TLDR: Comparison Table

| Feature | Biome + ESLint ✅ | ESLint + Prettier | Biome Only |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Formatting speed** | ✅ Very fast (Rust) | ⚠️ Slower (JS) | ✅ Very fast (Rust) |
| **Linting speed** | ✅ Fast (optimized) | ⚠️ Slower | ✅ Fast |
| **Framework rules** | ✅ ESLint ecosystem | ✅ Extensive | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Next.js support** | ✅ Via ESLint | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Limited |
| **React rules** | ✅ Via ESLint | ✅ Extensive | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Ecosystem maturity** | ✅ Best of both | ✅ Mature | ⚠️ Growing |
| **Setup complexity** | ⚠️ Two tools | ⚠️ Two tools | ✅ Single tool |
| **Bun integration** | ✅ Seamless | ✅ Good | ✅ Seamless |
| **Monorepo support** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |

**Main reasons:**

- **Maximum speed**: Biome's Rust-based implementation provides extremely fast formatting, aligning with our Bun-first, speed-optimized strategy
- **Optimized ESLint**: ESLint configured to disable checks Biome handles, making linting faster while retaining rule enforcement
- **Best dev tools**: Combines Biome's speed with ESLint's mature ecosystem for the best developer experience
- **Bun integration**: Works seamlessly with Bun bundler and package manager for fastest possible workflows
- **Fast feedback loops**: Minimal waiting time, excellent developer experience
- **Well-defined strategy**: Clear separation - Biome handles formatting (fast), ESLint handles rules only (fast)

## Implementation Strategy

### Biome Configuration

- **Formatting**: Biome handles all code formatting (faster than Prettier)
- **Linting**: Biome can handle basic linting, but we use ESLint for advanced rules

### ESLint Configuration

- **Rule enforcement only**: ESLint focused on code quality rules, not formatting
- **Disabled checks**: ESLint configured to disable checks that Biome handles (faster execution)
- **Framework support**: Retains Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Elysia rule support
- **Monorepo support**: Works with Turborepo and Bun workspaces

### Workflow

- **Format**: `bunx biome format --write` (extremely fast)
- **Lint**: `bunx biome lint` + `bunx eslint` (optimized for speed)
- **Check**: Both tools run in CI/CD for quality assurance

## Notes

- **Speed-first approach**: All tooling choices prioritize fast feedback and developer experience
- **Bun bundler**: We use Bun for bundling and package management for maximum speed
- **Best dev tools**: Carefully selected modern tooling stack optimized for 2024+ development workflows
- Biome + ESLint strategy provides the best balance of speed and functionality
- Monitor Biome's ecosystem growth for additional rule coverage
